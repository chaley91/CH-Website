I'm trying to get a better grip on my diet/nutrition - for now, going to use this as a landing page to contain my questions and notes on the topic.  A few things upfront on my mind:

- How can I improve impulse control for over-eating or unhealthy intake?
- What is the right daily caloric intake I should target, and how can I best track this?
- What balance of macros (carbs, proteins, fats) is best?
- What vitamins / supplements / whatever is potentially missing from my daily diet, and what is the best way to remedy this?

# Calories

I can't really get a straight answer on the right daily caloric intake that makes sense for my demographic.  Internet input ranges from 2,500 to 3,000 for maintaining weight, with more estimates for the right amount to cut from this maintenance threshold in order to lose weight in a healthy way.  That seems like a pretty broad range, but I figure if I try and aim for the low end of this range (2,500), I'll get a sense on whether I'm generally still hungry vs. satiated and adjust from there.  Not all calories are the same obviously (nutrients matter a lot), but it seems like calories are the most basic thing to focus on.  Seems like MyFitnessPal is highly regarded as the go-to tracking app for this stuff, so I'll start there.

# Diet Habits

Breakfast, or fast?

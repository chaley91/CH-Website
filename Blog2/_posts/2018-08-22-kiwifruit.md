This is the first (not copy/pasted from a tutorial) post on my new website design!  I'll keep this internal, but wanted to commemorate the occasion and lay out some next steps for myself.

First off - some website to-dos:

- Long term - continue exploring Jekyll templates and the SnowingPine example to emulate
- Explore mobile-friendly needs
- Anonymous feedback
- Ability to add images to blog posts
- Potentially de-couple posts from dates, to make this more of an ever-green site
- Find best way to deploy website code into production (need to migrate www.charliehaley.com domain to somewhere else)
- Automated email send-out / subscription function
- Password for gated area?
- Better UI program than Notepad

OK - and then in terms of ideas for actual post writing:

- Whatever comes to mind
- Water policy
- Syrian war sum-up
- Climate impact
- Game design, escape rooms, etc.
- Country profiles
- Anonymous feedback form
- Nutrition / supplement research
- Apartment lighting re-vamp
- Macro stats on jobs
- Money in politics
- AI
- Annual reflections
- Evergreen vs. temporary content

Notes for self on finances

- Seriously - optimize insurance costs.
- Venmo Chloe for $68 / 2 on Oct/Nov wireless
- Cancel Gympass
- Audit Uber/Lyft from October
- Double check PG&E payments
